# Fix for Database Error

You're seeing the error `django.db.utils.OperationalError: no such table: prepdata_app_imageclassificationresult` because the database tables haven't been created yet.

## Option 1: Run migrations manually

1. Run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Make sure you're in the project directory
cd /Users/atharvabadkas/Coding\ /my_prepapp

# Activate your virtual environment (if you're using one)
source .venv/bin/activate

# Create the migration files
python manage.py makemigrations

# Apply the migrations
python manage.py migrate
```

## Option 2: Use the provided script

1. Run the script we created:

```bash
# Make sure you're in the project directory
cd /Users/atharvabadkas/Coding\ /my_prepapp

# Activate your virtual environment (if you're using one)
source .venv/bin/activate

# Run the script
python run_migrations.py
```

## Option 3: Continue without database storage

If you don't need to store the classification results in the database, you can continue using the app as is. We've commented out the database save operation in the `handle_classification_results` function in `classifications.py`.

## After fixing

Once you've run the migrations, you can uncomment the database save operation in `classifications.py` if you want to store the results in the database:

```python
# In classifications.py, uncomment these lines:
ImageClassificationResult.objects.create(
    image_name=image['name'],
    classification_flag=image['classification_flag'],
    classification_status=result
)
```
